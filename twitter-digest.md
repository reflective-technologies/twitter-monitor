## 🤖 AI & Tech: The Main Character of Your Feed

**28% of all tweets mention AI** — this is the defining theme of your timeline.

### The Big Narrative: "Software Engineers Are Cooked"

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's Davos statement that AI might handle "all of what software engineers do" within 6-12 months is everywhere. But the discourse isn't doom — it's adaptation:

- **Claude Code adoption** is accelerating. Developers praise it over traditional tools. One account noted a company [canceled a $549M Salesforce contract](https://x.com) because Claude automated their customer support.

- **Counter-narrative exists**: Ryan Dahl (Node.js/Deno creator) argues developers add value ["far beyond memorizing syntax trivia"](https://x.com/simonw/status/2013291053462499380).
